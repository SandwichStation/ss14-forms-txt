# ss14-forms-txt
**This repo hosts a number of forms, documents, templates, and now even guides for you to use in ss14!**

NOTE:
The `# text label` seen at the top of every file is a Document Label, it will automatically label the document when the document is printed via a fax machine.
PLEASE remove the label and the line its on if you are not printing the document ingame but rather pasting it ingame.
